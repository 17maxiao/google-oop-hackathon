# CopeAI - Healthcare Therapy Companion App

## Overview

Have you ever ended a therapy session with amazing momentum and insights, only to return to the busy day-to-day of your life, and lose touch with the progress and discoveries you've made by your next session?

**CopeAI** addresses the critical gap between discussing coping strategies in therapy and applying them in daily life. Our full-stack healthcare application uses GenAI to analyze therapy session transcripts and generate personalized, actionable reminders with therapist-recommended coping strategies, like journaling, mindfulness exercises, and breathing techniques. This keeps patients engaged with their progress between sessions, and their responses are synthesized into a pre-session summary for the therapist, making future appointments more effective.

### The Problem

Patients often leave therapy sessions with valuable insights and coping strategies, but struggle to maintain momentum in their daily lives. The disconnect between weekly sessions can lead to:

- Lost progress and forgotten techniques
- Reduced engagement with therapeutic practices
- Less effective follow-up sessions
- Difficulty tracking what works and what doesn't

### Our Solution

CopeAI creates a continuous care loop:

1. **AI-Powered Analysis** - Automatically analyzes therapy transcripts to identify key themes and recommended strategies
2. **Therapist Oversight** - Clinicians review and approve personalized plans before deployment
3. **Patient Engagement** - Timely reminders and guided prompts keep patients connected to their progress
4. **Data-Driven Insights** - Weekly summaries help both patients and therapists understand what's working

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.8+
- npm or yarn

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5001`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The React app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Demo Data

The application comes pre-loaded with sample data to demonstrate the full user journey:

- **Sample Treatment Plan** - A pending plan for "Sarah Johnson" with 4 coping strategies
- **Sample User Plan** - An active plan showing various completion states and patient notes
- **Sample Week Summary** - AI-generated insights based on patient activity

### Demo Mode - Reset Feature

For hackathon presentations and demos, CopeAI includes a convenient **"Reset Demo"** button in the navigation bar:

1. Click the **ðŸ”„ Reset Demo** button in the top right
